### Web Development Project Part 4

In this part, I partially implemented the website that allows users to access the cutomer database.
This partial implementation uses the DOM and Shadow DOM APIs to create a custome HTML element.
This custom element allows users to fill out HTML forms in order to send requests to the server.
This partial implementation only allows users to create and find user accounts; the ability to create and modify transactions will be added in part 5.
