    <title>CS 444/544 Final: React Rotating Digits</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>React Rotating Digits</h1>
    <p> Animate digits rotating in a square with functionality identical to
      that given in the <a href="dom-rotate-digits.html"> DOM
	version</a>, but using React hooks.  
    </p>
   
    <ul>
      <li>Write a React component which renders the square of digits
	with the required animation.
      </li>
      <li>The provided code does not render the square at all.
	The component will need to provide the rendering.
      </li>
      <li>Your component should allow changing the animation period
	using the component's <code>props</code> with a default value
	of 3 seconds.</li>
      <li>This page loads all necessary React libraries as well as a
	babel transformer. Specifically, the <code>React</code>
	and <code>ReactDOM</code> objects are available for use
	by your code.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The source code for this page is available in
    <code>src/statics/rotate-digits/react-rotate-digits.html</code>.</p>

    <h2>Hints</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Start out your component by simply having it render JSX
	corresponding to the HTML provided in the DOM version.</li>
      <li> Your code should maintain the values of the current
	rotation of the digits string in a state variable.</li>
      <li> Render characters of the digits state variable into
	the correct cells</li>
      <li>Start an interval timer in an effect which is run only when
	the component is first mounted.  To ensure that the timer gets
	cleaned up, keep its id in an additional state variable.</li>
      <li>For every tick of the timer, rotate the digits string right.
	  Watch out for stale closures.</li>
      <li>You can use the same code for rotating right as you did
	in your DOM version.				   
      </li>
