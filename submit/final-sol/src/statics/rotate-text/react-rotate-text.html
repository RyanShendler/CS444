    <title>CS 444/544 Final: React Rotating Text</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>React Rotating Text</h1>
    
    <p> Animate rotating text with functionality identical to
      that given in the <a href="dom-rotate-text.html"> DOM
	version</a>, but using React hooks.  
    </p>
   
    <ul>
      <li>Write a React component which renders the input widget
	and rotating text animation.
      </li>
      <li>The provided code does not generate the content at all.
	The component will need to provide the rendering.
      </li>
      <li>Your component should allow changing the animation period
	using the component's <code>props</code> with a default value
	of 1 second.</li>
      <li>This page loads all necessary React libraries as well as a
	babel transformer. Specifically, the <code>React</code>
	and <code>ReactDOM</code> objects are available for use
	by your code.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The source code for this page is available in
    <code>src/statics/rotate-text/react-rotate-text.html</code>.</p>

    
    <div id="app">
      <div id="root"><!-- render react component here --></div>
    </div>

    <script type="text/babel">

      //TODO
      
    </script>

    <h2>Hints</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Start out your component by simply having it render JSX
	corresponding to the HTML provided in the DOM version.</li>
      <li> Your code should maintain the values of the current
	rotation of the text string in a state variable.</li>
      <li> Create a blur handler for the input widget which
	sets the text state variable to the provided value.</li>
      <li>Start an interval timer in an effect which is run only when
	the component is first mounted.  To ensure that the timer gets
	cleaned up, keep its id in an additional state variable.</li>
      <li>For every tick of the timer, rotate the text string left.
	  Watch out for stale closures.</li>
      <li>You can use the same code for rotating left as you did
	in your DOM version.				   
      </li>
    </ul>
