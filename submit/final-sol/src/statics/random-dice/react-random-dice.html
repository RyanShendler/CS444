    <title>CS 444/544 Final: React Random Dice</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>React Random Dice</h1>
    <p> Animate two dice with functionality identical to
      that given in the <a href="dom-random-dice.html"> DOM
	version</a>, but using React hooks.  
    </p>
   
    <ul>
      <li>Write a React component which renders the two dice and implements
	the required animation.
      </li>
      <li>The provided code does not render the dice at all.
	The component will need to provide the rendering.
      </li>
      <li>Your component should allow changing the animation period
	using the component's <code>props</code> with a default value
	of 1 second.</li>
      <li>This page loads all necessary React libraries as well as a
	babel transformer.  Specifically, the <code>React</code>
	and <code>ReactDOM</code> objects are available for use
	by your code.
      </li>
    </ul>

    The source code for this page is available in
    <code>src/statics/random-dice/react-random-dice.html</code>.

    <h2>Hints</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Start out your component by simply having it render JSX
	corresponding to the HTML provided in the DOM version.</li>
      <li> Your code should maintain the values of the two dice
	and # of rolls in state variables.</li>
      <li> Render the state variable into
	the JSX.</li>
      <li>Start an interval timer in an effect which is run only when
	the component is first mounted.  To ensure that the timer gets
	cleaned up, keep its id in an additional state variable.</li>
      <li>For every tick of the timer, roll the dice to update the
	dice state variables and increment the # of rolls.  Watch out
	for stale closures.</li>
      <li>You can use the same code for rolling a die as you did
	in your DOM version.				   
      </li>
