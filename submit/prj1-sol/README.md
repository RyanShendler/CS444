### Web Development Project Part 1

In this phase of the project, I developed the basic prototypes for functions that would be supported by this customer database:
1. newAccount() creates a new cutomer account with the specified holder ID and a randomized account ID
2. account() returns the account with specified account ID
3. info() returns account ID, holder ID, and account balance of a specified account
4. newAct() adds a new transaction to an account's transaction history
5. query() returns a list of transactions that satisfy some query
6. statement() returns a chronologically-sorted list of transactions that occured between a start and end date
